# Fracture Detection ML Web App

This is a Flask web application that allows users to upload X-ray images and automatically detect whether a **bone fracture** is present using a trained deep learning model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify medical images as fractured or not. The model was trained using Keras and TensorFlow, and the interface was built using Flask and HTML.

## Features

- Upload X-ray images (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.)
- Display the uploaded image on the page
- Predict fracture or no fracture using a pre-trained model
- Clean and responsive interface

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow / Keras
- HTML / CSS / Bootstrap
- PIL, NumPy
